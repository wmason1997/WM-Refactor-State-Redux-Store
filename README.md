I had a tutoring session with Jacob Carver on 03/16/2024. Jacob helped me to understand where my code was going wrong in [https://github.com/wmason1997/WM-State-Redux-Store](https://github.com/wmason1997/WM-State-Redux-Store). I tried to correct my mistakes for a while longer there as you can see, but too much had been changed so I thought it best to reset the starter code in a different repository here and go through the steps we went over again. Thanks, Jacob!

I consulted XLA and ChatGPT to debug issues introduced in this refactoring exercise.
